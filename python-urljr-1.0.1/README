URL-related utilites from JanRain, Inc.

This package contains the "fetchers" module, which provides a common
interface to urllib2 and curl for making HTTP requests.

Dependencies:

 * python (version 2.2 or better)


Recommended:

 * PycURL - http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/
   
   PycURL offers more protection when fetching URLs from untrusted sources,
   e.g. checking the server's SSL certificate, limiting the number of
   redirects it will follow, etc.
